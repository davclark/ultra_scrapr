from 1980\\u2019s Shogun Assassin, a martial arts movie released in Japan based on the graphic novel \\u201cLone wolf and cub\\u201d. This particular piece of dialogue occurs in the beginning of the film, spoken right before the title sequence\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe sample sets the mood for Liquid Swords: gritty, violent and dark\\\\n\\\\nThe Wu-Tang Clan have never hid their affinity for Asian culture and media, and have sampled many different movies from the region.\\\\n\\\\nFun fact: RZA\\u2019s 36 Chambers studio was flooded out just as production of Liquid Swords was finishing, and although the album was mostly completed, all studio equipment was more or less destroyed. In his 2nd book The Tao of Wu, RZA speaks on how this sample set the tone, not just for the Liquid Swords album, but for the Wu-Tang Clan as a whole after that flood.\\\\n\\\\nPost-release:\\\\n\\\\nThe monologue also appears in Quentin Tarantino\\u2019s Kill Bill Vol. 2, when Bill + Beatrix\\u2019s daughter BB is lulled to sleep by watching Shogun Assassin before her mom lays her dad to waste.\\\\n\\\\nAs Tarantino is an avid Wu-Tang fan and close homie of RZA, this is undoubtedly a nod to \\u2018Liquid Swords\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAWyHcAUfjg&t=1m30s\",\"32552\":\"The chorus of this song, \\u201cwhen the mc\\u2019s came\\u2026\\u201d is from Gza, Rza, and ODB\\u2019s old act. Hence, they\\u2019re taking it back to where it came from, preparing the listener to be \\u2018schooled\\u2019 in the art of hip-hop. A firm believer that Wu-Tang is the purest form of hip-hop, RZA often states things similar to this in songs. He simply wishes to remind people that they are pioneers of hip-hop and people should recognize where other rappers may have gotten their style from. As with so many Wu-Tang lyrics, \\u2018Do the Knowledge\\u2019 is a Five-Percenter reference, in this case to the 120 Lessons\\\\n\\\\nAlso it is a classic Willie Mitchell instrumental titled \\u201cGroovin\\'\\u201d that was used for the track. This comes in as the shift in samples takes place. This makes a reference to the soul music that heavily influenced much of the Wu Tang library, as noted in Shaolin Soul Vol 1 and 2. Meant as a post response to the interlude from a classic kung fu film, that many Wu-Tang members incorporate into their on stage personas and lyrics.\",\"33050\":\"GZA explaining what a battle will mean: You\\u2019ll get flipped, cut, chopped, and the like. His flow is smooth and constant, and his lyrics is dope to us lyrical addicts\",\"33063\":\"Medina is the second holy land of Islam and the burial place of the prophet Muhammad.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\u2019s also Five Percenter slang for Brooklyn, where GZA is originally from. Pelan is the Bronx, Mecca is Manhattan/Harlem, and The Desert is Queens.\",\"35243\":\"Another Shogun Assassin reference. The phrase \\u201cchild educator\\u201d also reminds me of a line from a certain classic song\",\"35654\":\"A reference to the 1960\\u2019s television series Mission Impossible, which was later turned into a movie franchise\",\"36072\":\"A reference to the song Clan in Da Front, GZA\\u2019s solo track from Wu-Tang Clan\\u2019s debut album Enter the Wu-Tang. GZA is also referring to the Clan itself.\",\"38751\":\"It\\u2019s true\\u2014and the teeny speakers in my iPhone are even worse!\",\"38752\":\"A reference to LL Cool J\\u2019s classic \\u2018Rock the Bells,\\u2019 (which originally had a Bob James sample instead of the Rick-Rubinized rock guitars)\",\"41974\":\"GZA disses other rappers with poor lyricism while also dissing the fashion choice of wearing zodiac sign sweatshirts\",\"41977\":\"Table stacks (steaks) a verse on the gamble. So my energy is felt once the cards are dealt because I\\u2019m talking about gambling.\\\\n  \\\\n    GZA is so wealthy that his minimum bet in poker is so high others would think twice before matching it\\\\n\\\\nOnce the cards are dealt, the weight of the money riding on the hand makes it seem like his opponents have been hit by black belts and cyclones due to how good GZA\\u2019s luck is\\\\n\\\\nIn the second half of these rhymes it becomes clear that he uses the card game gamble as a metaphor for his rap battling skills, his minimum bet is a verse and the energy is felt when they\\u2019re battling. Then the GZA hits the verse with the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts attacking the mic like cyclones or typhoons, it has nothing to do with his gambling and luck!\",\"41979\":\"He doesn\\u2019t write pages of bad lyrics. He considers what he\\u2019s going to write before putting it on paper.\\\\n\\\\nThis line specifically refers to how this track was recorded: He doesn\\u2019t need ink and paper to be able to rap, referring to his skill to construct (and store) rhymes in his mind and spit them out in the form of freestyle if and when ever necessary.\",\"41980\":\"Train metaphors \\u2014 your plan gets \\u201cderailed\\u201d like an Amtrak train, which had a series of bad derailments in the mid-1990s.\",\"41986\":\"GZA\\u2019s songs are completely different from other rapper\\u2019s, and once you get into them it will be hard for you to get out\\\\n\\\\nAlso a reference to Wu Tang\\u2019s debut album that dropped a few years prior. \\u201cWide entrance\\u201d may mean as in the wide variety of good artists in Wu Tang.\",\"61536\":\"Unlike most rappers, GZA sticks nicely to just the role of judge, unlike the judge-jury-executioner combo of most rappers.\\\\n\\\\nAllah Justice is GZA\\u2019s Nations of Gods and Earths name.\",\"61537\":\"A play on state penitentiaries and pens used to write rhymes.\",\"61538\":\"GZA rhymes have cement-burrowing power than even radio waves can\\u2019t match.\",\"62529\":\"Either this logo or the Wu logo.

It isn\\u2019t meant to stand for anything. I\\u2019m talking about my skills and how I\\u2019m better than the rest. Usually I take a beat home and write to it for a few days, but it wasn\\u2019t like that with this track. I think RZA played the beat for me and I just spit to it right there. The hook was actually a routine from around \\u201884 that me, RZA, and Ol\\' Dirty would do.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nTrue to form, GZA drops 11 similes and 13 metaphors in just his two verses on this track.\"}}'"
