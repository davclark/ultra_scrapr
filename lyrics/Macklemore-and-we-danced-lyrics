And we danced
And we cried
And we laughed
And had a really, really, really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives
Our lives (our lives)
Our lives (our lives)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Tonight (tonight!)
Tonight (tonight!)
Tonight!
Cause tonight's the night
Am I right?
Dance

Feels like the night for a party
My nature's so naughty
There's a knock on the door
It's the neighbors
Quit cock-blocking
We're having a ho-down, you hoes down?
Don't make me pull my hose out
Cause it's big, long, pink, strong
And been known to dance, like, all night long
Grab my hand, play this song
DJ, save my life, come on!
Leave your fear, back off the wall
Free of beat and pussy pop
And if you don't have a pussy
Pop a cock into a booty
Into a booty

And we danced
And we cried
And we laughed
And had a really, really, really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives

I am not, I am not going to stand on the wall
I will dance, I will dance, I will break that ass off
And I see you in the corner, corner looking so small
Doing the robot like, "If I die tonight, at least I went hard"
I will not, I will not give a damn who watches me
I will live, I will live! Liberate the fox in me
I will be the discoball
Freakin' give my all
To whatever girl's booty
I'm freaking on
I'm not skeeting, nah
It's just freaking hot

"...alright, I skeeted."

I will not be a mannequin
The ego banished
The roof's on fire
Let's burn down the Vatican
I will moon walk to Pluto in honor of Michael Jackson
In heaven he'll be saying that man is tight at dancing
Rip to the king, Michael Jackson, we learned it all from you
Dedicate this to the dance floor
Party up the sorrow 'til tomorrow morning happens
We pledge allegiance to the DJ
Put your hands up

And we danced
And we cried
And we laughed
And had a really, really, really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives
Our lives

You see me looking at you from that bar right over there
But your friends are huddled up and they are hating on a player
I just want to dance with you
Get on the back of you
Tip tap the boots
Extract the truth
Da-Dance with you
Get on the back of you
Da-Dance dance dance
"Awesome!"

Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
(Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh)

Hey-oh, hey-oh
(Hey-oh, hey-oh)

Uh-ah-ba-bo
(Uh-ah-ba-bo)

Zib-oh-da-we-bab-ba-dap-bop-bop
(Zib-oh-da-we-bab-ba-dap-bop-bop)

And we danced
And we cried
And we laughed
And had a really, really, really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives
