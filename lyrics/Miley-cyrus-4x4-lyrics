[Chorus]
Round and round and away we go (x2)
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
Round and round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Verse 1]
I'm a female rebel can't you tell?
Bang on the dashboard, just chipped a nail
Lean out the window that's when I yell
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself (x2)
Police want to get him and put him in jail
I'mma do whatever to get him his bail
Hooked on donuts and rooster-tails

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in that passenger seat riding high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I'm a female rebel, can't you see?
Riding around your backyard who could it be?
Pull out on the scene right out of the seat
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat
He don't understand what he's doing to me
Deep down inside like a pitbull in heat
Someone's coming so we head for the streets

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Bridge]
It's 12 o'clock and I don't want to party
My big boyfriend and my big truck hobby
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
Now I got dirt all over my body
Might as well light a L
His big fog lights is bright as hell
Calls it off, he starts to yell
He hits the gas so I grab the rail

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Sure you want to ride with me?
If you scared don't lie to me
I'm a crazy motherfucker from the Midwest
With a Mississippi flow and an Arch rest
Four by four up the altar steps
We doing donuts underneath the arch, yes!
I need a chick on time don't mind being early
A ride-or-die down like six thirty
A straight-up chick like twelve o'clock
"I don't know where he at", that's what she tell the cops
Take a stand for a nigga, raise a hand for a nigga
"I solemnly swear he was with me all day"
To the judge, "he the one I love"
Hell they could tell, she don't even budge
Round and round we go
Don't stop 'til I tell you so

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Outro]
I'm a female rebel can't you tell can't you tell?
I'm a female rebel can't you tell can't you tell?
