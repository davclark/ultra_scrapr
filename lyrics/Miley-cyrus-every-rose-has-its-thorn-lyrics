[Verse 1]
We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Yeah, I tried
But I guess that's why they say

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does

[Verse 2]
I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could let you know somehow

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But that scar, that scar remains

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
I know I could've saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of making love
We both made our separate ways

And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
And to hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

[Chorus]
