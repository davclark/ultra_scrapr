[Verse 1]
No sun will shine in my day today
The high yellow moon won't come out to play
(That high yellow moon won't come out to play)
I said darkness has covered my light
And has changed my day into night, yeah
Where is the love to be found ?
Won't someone tell me ?
Cause life (sweet life)
Must be somewhere to be found (must be somewhere for me)
Instead of concrete jungle
Where the living is hardest
Concrete jungle
Man, you've got to do your best

[Verse 2]
No chains around my feet but I'm not free
I know I am bound here in captivity
Yeah, now (never, know)
I've never known happiness
I've never known what sweet caress is
Still, I'll be always laughing like a clown
Won't someone help me ?
Cause I (sweet life)
I've got to pick myself from off the ground
(must be somewhere for me)
In this concrete jungle
I said, what do you got for me now
Oh ! Concrete jungle
Why won't you let me be, now ?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I said that life (sweet life)
It must be somewhere to be found (must be somewhere for me)
Oh, instead of concrete jungle
Illusion (concrete, jungle !)
Confusion (concrete, jungle !)

[Outro]
Eh ! Concrete jungle
You name it, you've got it in
Concrete jungle, now
Eh ! Concrete jungle
What do you got for me, now ?
