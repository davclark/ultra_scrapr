Hey girl, I want you to know
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go

And hey girl, I tell you no lie
Something deep inside of me's going to die
If you say so long, if this is goodbye

Hey girl, this can't be true
How am I supposed to exist without you?

Hey girl, Now don't put me on
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone
How will I live? How can I go on?

Hey girl, now sit yourself down
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground
Don't go away

Hey girl!
