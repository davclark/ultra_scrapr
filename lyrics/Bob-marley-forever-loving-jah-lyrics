[Intro]
We'll be forever loving Jah
We'll be forever loving Jah

[Verse 1]
Some they say see them walking up the street
They say we're going wrong to all the people we meet
But we won't worry, we won't shed no tears
We found a way to cast away the fears
Forever, yeah!

[Chorus]
(We'll be forever loving Jah) We'll be forever
(We'll be forever loving Jah) Forever, yes, and forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) There'll be no end

[Verse 2]
So, old man river, don't cry for me
A-have got a running stream of love you see
So, no matter what stages, oh stages
Stages, stages they put us through
We'll never be blue
No matter what rages, oh rages
Changes, rages they put us through
We'll never be blue
We'll be forever, yeah!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Because only a fool lean upon
Lean upon his own misunderstanding
And then what has been hidden
From the wise and the prudent
Been revealed to the babe and the suckling
In everything, in every way, I say, yeah!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Because just like a tree planted
Planted by the rivers of water
That bringeth forth fruits
Bringeth forth fruits in due season
Everything in life got its purpose
Find its reason in every season
Forever, yeah!

[Chorus]
