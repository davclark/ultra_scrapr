[Verse 1]
It's been in the past for a while
I get a flash and I smile
Am I crazy?
To still miss you baby

It was real, it was right
But it burned too hot to survive
All that's left is
All these ashes

[Pre-Chorus]
Where does the love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together

[Chorus]
I have to know why
I had to lose you
Now you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean

Do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do

[Verse 2]
In a dream you appeared
For a while you were here
So I keep sleeping
Just to keep you with me

I'll draw a map
Connect the dots
With all the memories that I've got
What I'm missing
I'll keep re-living

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Speaking]
This is it
Let go
Breathe

[Sung]
You don't have to love me
For me to, baby - ever understand
Just know I love the time that we both had
And I don't ever want to see you sad, be happy
Cause I don't want to hold you
If you don't want to tell me you love me babe
Just know I'm going to have to walk away
I'll be big enough for both of us to say, be happy

Do do do
Do do do do (be happy)
Do do do do do do do (be happy)
Do do do do do do do
Be happy

[Outro]
Mm
Be happy
