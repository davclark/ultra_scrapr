[Verse 1]
Buffalo soldier, dreadlocked rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

I mean it, when I analyse the stench
To me it makes a lot of sense
How the dreadlocked rasta was a Buffalo Soldier

Buffalo Soldier, he was a dreadlocked rasta
He was a Buffalo Soldier and a dreadlocked rasta
Stolen from Africa, brought to America

[Verse 2]
And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said it was a Buffalo Soldier, dreadlocked Rasta
Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America

[Verse 3]
If you know your history
Then you would know where you're coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the heck do I think I am

[Verse 4]
I'm just a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, win the war for America

Said he, woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!
Woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!

[Verse 5]
Buffalo Soldier trodding through the land, wo-ho-ooh!
Said he want to ran and then you want a hand
Trodding through the land, yea-hea, yea-ea

Said he was a Buffalo Soldier win the war for America
Buffalo Soldier, dreadlocked Rasta
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Driven from the mainland to the heart of the Caribbean
