Return of the Mack
Get up, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game nope nope y’all can’t copy
Yup, Bad, moonwalking
This here, is our party
My posse's been on Broadway
And we did it our way
Grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I’m on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But, I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat, crushing labels out here
Nah, they can’t tell me nothing
We give that to the people
Spread it across the country
Labels out here
Nah they can’t tell me nothing
We give it to the people
Spread it across the country

[Hook x2: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

[Verse 2]
Now can I kick it, thank you
Yeah I’m so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y’all can’t stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heart beat
And I’m eating at the beat
Like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on shark week
Raw! Tell me go up, gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never, ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song and it goes like
"Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching"
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility, and then we keep marching, I said

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey-ee ay-ee ay-ee ay ay-ee ay-ee, hey
And all my people say

Na na na na, na na na na
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And all my people say

Mack-le-eh-eh-eh-eh-more!

Let the night come before the fight is won
Some might run against the test
But those who try once the fight comes
Their fear is there to prove courage exist
