[Chorus]
In this life, in this life, in this life
In this, oh sweet life
We're (we're coming in from the cold)
We're coming in (coming in), coming in (coming in)
Coming in (coming in), coming in (coming in)
Coming in from the cold!

[Verse 1]
It's you, it's you, it's you I'm talking to
Well, you (it's you), you (it's you), you I'm talking to now
Why do you look so sad, and forsaken?
When one door is closed, don't you know, other is open?

Would you let the system make you kill your brotherman?
No, no, no, no, no, no! No, Dread, no! Woo!
Would you make the system make you kill your brotherman?
(No, Dread, no!)
Would you make the system get on top of your head again?
(No, Dread, no!)
Well, the biggest man you ever did see was - was just a baby

[Chorus] [x2]
In this life (in this life)
In this (in this life, oh sweet life):
Coming in from the cold!
We're coming in (coming in), coming in-a (coming in)
Coming in (coming in), ooh! (coming in)
Coming in from the cold!

[Verse 2]
It's you, you, you I'm talking
Well, yes, you, bilyabong you! (it's you)
Ew! - you I'm talking to now
We-e-ell, why do you look so, look so, look so sad
Look so sad and forsaken?
Don't you know: When one door is closed - when one door is closed
Many more is open?

We-e-e-ell, would you let the system get on top of your head again?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Dread, no!
Would you let the system make you kill your brotherman?
No, Dread, no!
We-e-e-ell, would you make the system get on top of your head again?
(No, Dread, no!) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Well, the biggest - biggest man you ever - ever
Did-a see was-a was-a once a baby

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We're coming in-a, coming in-a, coming in-a, coming in-a!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yea-ea-ea-eah!
Coming in from the cold
Coming in (coming in), coming in (coming in)
(coming in) (coming in)
(coming in) from the - from the cold!
