[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
Ayo, this time it's for my family, we ride or die
It's in the blood til the death, now aim for the sky
My four blow fo sure, for dough, for only
It's money, drugs, and hot slugs
You know Bleek squeeze hammers til they nail me
Fuck wha niggas tell me
Street scholar, keep firing is what they tell me
Drug chemist, thug nigga be named Memphis
Straight from da borough of dem B.K. niggas
Where we rob for the fun of it, hustle for the drug of it
Wrap money in rubber bands, just for the love of it
Straight from my ghetto, we listen to heavy metal like
Desert Eagles, street sweepers, loud metal
It's hit and run now, motherfuck anyone of you
We dem niggas be in ya crib just like furniture
Pop up wit the gun in ya
Release one for zero-zero M (Yeah)
Bleek-R-O-C (Yeah yeah) dot com (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
This Philly cat back at it
Still throwing crack at it
Still fucking wit them crack addicts
Still bust 'em wit them black 'matics
It's ain't the bucks, it's the rush
You trying to get my ass at it
They say I think ass backwards
Fuck how I act, as long as I stack, it's all mathematics
Our tracks nice, hug the block to track dice
Late night, club night, Mac attract dikes
I pull up, Cadillac truck nice
Two guns, you know Mac pack gat twice
Gets that crack back with that ice
No joke wit the coke, I whips that right
No doubt, never a droubt, gets that price (Uh)
It gets that nice, when you live that life
Papi knows yours name and you ditched that wife nigga
Gets that green nigga, gets that chain nigga

[Amil]
I get forty G's a feature now
Hold Franklins like a Aretha now
In the SL two seater now
And I'm in nothing but diamonds
I'm the illest female that you heard thus far
Five-five with the thirty-four B-cup bra
I don't fuck with them cats who ain't up to par
I get niggas for cash, clothes, jeweleries, plus cars
I'm talking rent money, I'm talking bank money
I'm talking Martha Keats step of wit the rent money
Moving on up, two in the sauna
Still ride through the block, pull up on the corner, plus
Plus, give me an inch so I can take a mile
I bring life like a new born naked child
Bitches trying to come up, gotta wait a while
As of now, Amil-lion just played ya style
(You dealing wit), nigga

[Jay-Z]
The, the Roc, the the, the Roc
(Let me talk to ya'll niggas real quick)
The, the Roc, uh uh, the Roc

Yo, y'all niggas truly ain't ready for this "Dynasty" thing
Y'all thinking Blake Carrington, I'm thinkin more like Ming
I got four nephews, and they all writing
They all young and wild, plus they all like things
And I'm having a child, which is more frighting
What y'all about to witness is big business kid
Big bosses, cocky, and big Benzsesses
Come through flossing them shiny rims it is
And "loss" don't pop up in their sentences
I think you understand what type of event this is
I don't think you know how focused young Memphis is
Or how Sigel's so real, when you add on Amil
This is much more than rap, it's black entrepreneur
Clothing, movie, and films, we come to conquer it all
Rocawear, eighty mill in like, eighteen months
You could bullshit with rap if you want, motherfuckers
When it's all said and done, we gon see what's what
Holla at Hov, I'll be in the cut (What, huh)

The, the Roc, the the, the Roc
The, the Roc, the uh, the Roc (You rollin wit)
The Roc, dynasty niggas (Whoop)
Uh-huh, get'cha mind right, c'mon
Roc-A-Fella Records, 2000 nigga
Get'cha mind right, holla
