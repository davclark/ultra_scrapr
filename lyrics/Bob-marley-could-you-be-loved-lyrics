[Intro]
Could you be love and be loved?
Could you be love and be loved?

[Verse]
Don't let them fool yah
Or even try to school yah! Oh, no!
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell if what you're thinking is not right!
Love would never leave us alone
I am the darkness there must come out the light

[Chorus] [x 2]
(The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you)
Love your brotherman!

[Bridge]
Don't let them change
Or even rearrange yeah!
We've got a life to live
They say: only - only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive!  Yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(You aren't going to miss your water until your well runs dry
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied.)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be - could you be love?
Could you be - could you be love?)
Say something! Say something!
(Could you be - could you be - could you be love?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be love?)
Say something! Say something! (Say something!)
Say something! Say something! (Could you be love?)
Say something! Say something! Reggae, reggae!
Say something! Rockers, rockers!
Say something! Reggae, reggae!
Say something! Rockers, rockers!
Say something! (Could you be loved?)
Say something! Huh!
Say something! Come on!
Say something! (Could you be - could you be - could you be love?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be love?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be - could you be love?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be love?)
