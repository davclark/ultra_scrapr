Ice Cube: You know me, Ice Cube, I'm like a Glock nigga, I always got a hot sixteen, knamean

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
I was a young lad of seventeen
My life had yet to show its ugly face
Only a pretty façade, hey God it's me
Remember three, thousand
The one who used to pray to be a rapper
My child's in the third grade
His favorite rapper wasn't rapping till he heard me
I wasn't rapping till I heard something called Erik B
And Rakim's Paid in Full
Rapper's really gettin' paid in full
So full that the kid's dont go to school in hopes of becomin' one of us
The only requirement is your bus
Now college is lookin' slim, product is hookin' them
Before their brains fully develop they get enveloped by the the vision tele
The television tells them their vision
Now it's hard for them to make decisions with out feelin'
Uncooled, unschooled, thumb rule
Rule of thumb, can't be dumb
I wish I would've studied abroad
Well I studied a broad and she studied me back
And my course was hard
That was that, this is this, listen up
Cause all I'm saying is
If thirty's the new twenty, thirty's the new twenty for them wheels as well
They lookin' for the mic or some pills to sell
While the girls are steady graduatin'
Nigga's standin' on the corner hatin', debatin'
Well should I get the new J's or the Kobe's
And they rollin' so they wide awake for four days
Ha, I'm a G-entleman, let's get re-aquainted
I am Andre Benjamin

[Hook: Jay-Z]
I used to let my pants sag, not givin’ a fuck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to play the block like that
I used to carry knots like that
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Baby boy, cause I’m all grown up, ha

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Ya’ll roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day
Ya’ll young’uns chase, I’m Patron' it straight
I like South Beach but I’m in St. Tropez
Ya’ll drink Dom, but not Rose’
Hey, ya chick shop at the mall
My chick burning down Bergdorf’s
Comin' back with Birkin bags
Your chick is like, what type of purse is that
I’m from the era when niggas don’t snitch
You from the era where snitchin' is the shit
I’m afraid of the future
Ya’ll respect the one who got shot, I respect the shooter
Ya’ll go to parties to ice grill
I go to parties to party with nice girls
Young boys gotta chill, thirty’s the new twenty, nigga I’m so hot still

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Jay-Z, what can a young motherfucka tell me
About the LAPD, about the air that we breathe
Nothin', nada, zero, zilch
I want tits for fun, you want tits for milk
I'm all leather and silk, your fuckin' t-shirt look like a quilt
Playground king, climb the monkey bars that I built
Thirty's the new twenty, Phantom's the new Bentley
Nigga, dont tempt me, I'll bury you up in Tempe
And if I catch a ghost rider, tie him to a tree, gasoline like the lighter
Burn, you motherfuckin' fighta, treat you like George Bush treat Al-Qaeda
This is Guantanamo, think I'm a ho, I made the honor roll, mixed with Geronimo
Before this mic will pass, learn how to wipe your nose before you wipe your ass

[Hook]
