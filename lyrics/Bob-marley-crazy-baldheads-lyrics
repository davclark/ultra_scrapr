[Intro]
They are crazy, they are crazy
We are going to chase those crazy
Baldheads out of town
Chase those crazy baldheads
Out of our town

[Verse 1]
I and I build a cabin
I and I plant the corn
Didn't my people before me
Slave for this country
Now you look me with that scorn
Then you eat up all my corn

[Chorus]
We are going to chase those crazy
Chase them crazy
Chase those crazy baldheads out of town

Sta-diddly doo dit stip stop steal dil ya do stop steal ya diddily dil ya di day
Sta diddly diddly diddly diddly diddly diddly do da dit sta ba do stop stilly di dread

[Verse 2]
Build your penitentiary, we build your schools
Brainwash education to make us the fools
Hate is your reward for our love
Telling us of your God above

[Chorus] [x2]

[Verse 3]
Here comes the conman
Coming with his con plan
We won't take no bribe
We have got to stay alive

[Chorus]
