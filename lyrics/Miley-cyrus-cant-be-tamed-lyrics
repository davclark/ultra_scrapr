[Verse 1]
For those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way, yep, 24 hours a day cause I'm (hot like that)
Every guy, everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection, I always gets a ten cause I'm built like that

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I go through guys like money flying out the hands
They try to change me but they realize they can't
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan
If you're going to be my man understand

[Chorus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

[Verse 2]
If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya or tell you to go to hell (I'm not a brat like that)
I'm like a puzzle but all of my pieces are jagged
If you can understand this, we can make some magic, I'm wrong like that

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna to be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Well, I'm not a trick you play, I'm wired a different way
I'm not a mistake, I'm not a fake, it's set in my DNA
Don't change me, don't change me
Don't change me, don't change me
(I can't be tamed)

[Pre-Chorus 2 + Chorus]
