[Intro]
Oh yeah
Come on

[Verse 1]
You get the limo out front
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color
Yeah, when you are famous it can be kind of fun
It is really you but no one ever discovers
In some ways you are just like all your friends
But on stage you are a star

[Pre-Chorus]
You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show

[Chorus]
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that it is the best of both worlds
The best of both worlds

[Verse 2]
You go to movie premiers (is that Orlando Bloom?)
Hear your songs on the radio
Living' two lives is a little weird
But school is cool cause nobody knows
Yeah you get to be a small town girl
But big time when you play your guitar

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Pictures and autographs
You get your face in all the magazines
The best part is that you get to be whoever you want to be
(Best! Best!) Yeah, the best of both!
(Best! Best!) You got the best of both!
(Best! Best!) Come on, the best of both!
Who would of thought that a girl like me
Would double as a superstar

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]
You get the best of both worlds
Without the shades and the hair
You can go anywhere

[Outro]
You get the best of both girls
Mix it all together
Oh, yeah
It is so much better because you know you have got the best of both worlds
