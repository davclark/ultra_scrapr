[Verse 1]
Every day, up before the sun's up
Quick shower, dress and head to Starbucks
Start plannin' all the things I gotta get done
Homework and school get the best of my time, yeah
But all week I've been dreamin' 'bout the shoreline
Just relaxin', layin' out in the sun

[Chorus 1]
Goin' to the beach this weekend
Me and some of my best girlfriends
Puttin' on the suntan lotion
Wrote you guys a little devotion
Tryin' out a brand new bikini
Maybe drive a few boys crazy
Makin' sure the fun never ends
We're goin' to the beach, this weekend

[Verse 2]
One suitcase, make-up and a camera
Few bucks for Pepsi and a pizza
Lips locked
And water tube toe rings
Take a ride in a ragtopedo
And cruise the coastline listenin' to the Eagles
And turn it up, for everyone can hear us sing

[Chorus 2]
We're goin' to the beach this weekend
Me and some of my best girlfriends
Playin' in the clear, blue water
Ridin' double long wave runners
Dancin' 'cross the red hot summer sand
Lookin' pretty hot in our new tans
Makin' sure the fun never ends
We're goin' to the beach, this weekend

[Chorus 1]
