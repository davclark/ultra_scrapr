She stood on the tracks
Waving her arms
Leading me to that third rail, SHOCK
Quick as a wink
She changed her mind

She gave me a night
Thats all it was
What will it take until I STOP
Kidding myself, wasting my time, whoa

Theres nothing else I can do
Cause Im doing it All For Leyna
I dont want anyone new
Cause Im living it All For Leyna
Theres nothing in it for you
Cause Im giving it all to Leyna

We laid on the beach
Watching the tide
She didn't tell me there were, ROCKS
Under the waves
Right off the shore

Washed up on the sand
Barely alive
Wishing the undertow would, STOP
How can a man take anymore, whoa

Theres nothing else I can do
Cause Im doing it All For Leyna
I dont want anyone new
Cause Im living it All For Leyna
Theres nothing in it for you
Cause Im giving it all to Leyna

Im failing in school
Loosing my friends
Making my family loose their minds
I dont want to eat
I dont want to sleep
I only want Leyna, one more time

Now, Im in my room
Watching the tube
Telling myself, she still may, DROP
Over to say, shes changed her mind

So, I wait in the dark
Listening for her
Instead of hearing my old man saying, STOP
Kidding yourself, wasting your time

Theres nothing else I can do
Cause Im doing it All For Leyna
I dont want anyone new
Cause Im living it All For Leyna
Theres nothing in it for you
Cause Im giving it all to Leyna

All For Leyna

All For Leyna

All For Leyna

All For Leyna

All For Leyna

All For Leyna
