[Verse 1]
Every weeks the same
Stuck in school's so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Getting up at 8 AM's crazy

Tired of being told what to do
So unfair
So uncool

The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'til I hear the bell ring

Cause that's time when we're going to
(Time when we're going to)

[Chorus]
Breakout
Let the party start
We're going to stay out
Going to break some hearts
We're going to dance till the dance floor falls apart
Uh oh, all over again
We're going to wake up everyone we know
We're going to have some fun, going to lose control
Feels so good, to let go-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Hanging out's just something we like to do
My friends and the mess we get into
These are the lessons that we choose
Not a book full of things we'll never use

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I wish it would never end
Spending time with my friends
Oh with my friends!

[Chorus x2]
