[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
I don't wanna leave home
Without your love
Without it

[Verse 1]
You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it
Then what'd you say forever for
If forever is out the door
I'll ignore when you call

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You told me you were coming back, right back
You promised it was real and I believe that
But if I fall for it again, I would be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you?
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses, I just let 'em die
I was crazy thinking you were mine
It was all just a lie

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I always knew I never wanted this
I never thought it could happen
You acted like you wanted this
But then you led me on
I thought you would be there when I go
You promised you would be there when I go
But all broken promises I won't miss, I'm finished
Underneath, all I know are the facts
When I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies
Been there done that

[Chorus]
