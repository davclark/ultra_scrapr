[Intro]
Get Up, Stand Up, stand up for your right
Get Up, Stand Up, stand up for your right
Get Up, Stand Up, stand up for your right
Get Up, Stand Up, don't give up the fight

[Verse 1]
Preacher man don't tell me heaven is under the earth
I know you don't know what life is really worth
Is not all that glitters in gold and
Half the story has never been told
So now you see the light, aay
Stand up for your right. Come on

[Chorus] [x2]
Get Up, Stand Up, stand up for your right
Get Up, Stand Up, don't give up the fight

[Verse 2]
Most people think great God will come from the sky
Take away everything, and make everybody feel high
But if you know what life is worth
You would look for yours on earth
And now you see the light
You stand up for your right, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Get Up, Stand Up. Life is your right
So we can't give up the fight
Stand up for your right, Lord, Lord
Get Up, Stand Up. Keep on struggling on
Don't give up the fight

We're sick and tired of your ism and skism game
Die and go to heaven in Jesus' name, Lord
We know when we understand
Almighty God is a living man
You can fool some people sometimes
But you can't fool all the people all the time
So now we see the light
We going to stand up for our right

So you'd better...

[Chorus] [x2]
