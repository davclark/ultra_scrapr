Can I kick it?
Yes you can

(I'm kinda lovin that)

Can I kick it?
Yes you can
Can I kick it?

Rocafella forever Hov for life
Debuts a classic first album four mics
Shoulda gotta five but niggas lack foresight
But I don't giva fuck I ain't do it for the hype
I do it for the hustlas for the ghetto for their plight
For the struggle for those who bubble white
For fly four by fours, roofless cars, flawless ice
For the pain for y'all to know what its like
For every time it rains 40 days and 40 nights
For every promise made that never saw the light
I'll get my own forty acres give me four nights
Four o's a Glock forty for the jackers and I'm Spike
Or the four four will suffice
A fourteen year old to look out for the vice
You can sit back and just wait for the flight
Boy will take off like I've been strippin all my life
That's the type of metaphors I write
That let niggas know I was real before the mic
Four front rows had the fur at the fight
No PETA on my Peter -- left some room for the divas
In the suite we'll meet up if you wild for the night
On the rampage champagne pours on the floor
For all those who ain't make it here and lost they life
Wouldn't forget yall for any price
Not for no hoes not for no ice
Not for no fame nor for bright lights
So I'mma end this here real mean but I'm right
Forty Four Fours motherfucker, I'm NICE
